This program allows the user to know how much will cost him to build a full kitchen with all home appliances, sinks, stones, etc...
All the materials are listed in the database "orcamentos_cozinha.db", the program is in portuguese as it was built for my father's company.
One can add, update or delete elements from the database through the "atualizar.html" webpage, to run the server just run app.py.
The home page allows you to see all the data in the database in a more aesthetic way and allows you to choose the type of furniture you want to add, then just write the necessary inputs and the price will come out allowing you to add or remove pieces to the list.
There's 7 files which are basically the favicon in several formats which are the PNGs inside the static folder but outside the images folder along with the .ico file and thesite.webmanifest file.
"calcularOrc.py" is the file in which you imports all the modules for the calculation of the prices of each piece of furniture and "manipular_db.py" is the file which I used to edit my database.
There's also the "moveis" folder which contains the  modules for the calculation of the prices of each piece of furniture.
